This is a file containg all my scripts weather they are done, in testing, or undergoing bug fixes/updates.
All of these scripts unless specifed other wise are made for windows with some posible future updates makeing them usable on linux. 
All comments are welcome and everything on hear is open source so you may do as you wish with it my only request being any features/bugs you want/fix do leave a message for me so I can see about adding them for everyone
